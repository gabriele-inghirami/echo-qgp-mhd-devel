!photon gas law
!*** It is possible to use up to 5 parameters a, b, c, d, e simply writing their values before inserting them in the formula ***
a=3.0
!*** Write here the equation of state pr=pr(rh, en) (i.e. the dependence of pressure pr on energy density en and density rh) ***
!*** Units must be GeV/fm^3 ***
pr=en/a
