! WARNING: this subroutine is designed to use the relation:
! en= (g * PI^2 /(30) * temp^4 -b)
! where pr means energy density (Gev/fm^3), temp is temperature (GeV), hbar is the Planck's Constant, c the speed of light in v.
! we compute PI^2/30=0.32898681, while (hbar*c)**(3./4.)=0.29606692
! Please, insert the g and b constants and the program automatically will retrieve temperature given the energy density

g=37.
b=0.
! WARNING: this relation is not accurate, especially with b=0, put there just for semplicity!

! to obtain the temperature in GeV, we have to multiply by (hbar*c)^3/4=0.197327^3/4=0.2960669195
! here follows temperature computation:
temp=(((en+b)/(g*0.32898681))**0.25)*0.29606692

!this is for Gubser's flow test
!temp=(en/13.8997)**0.25*0.29606692
